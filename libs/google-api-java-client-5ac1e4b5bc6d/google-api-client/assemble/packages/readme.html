<h2>Packages for the ${project.name} ${project.version}</h2>

<p>While developing a Java application for mobile devices (such as on
Android), it is convenient to use the <code>${project.artifactId}-${project.version}.jar</code>
from the root directory. Unfortunately, its large size makes it unwieldy,
especially since you are likely to only use a relatively small subset of the
library. That results in a slower download of your application, and a slower
start time for your application as it is loaded into memory. If multiple
applications on the end-user's mobile device include a copy of the whole, then
the problem grows worse for the end user for each new application.</p>

<p>One possible solution is to use the packaged jars in this directory
instead. There is exactly one jar for each Java package in the client library,
and you only include what you need. Be careful to understand the acyclic package
dependency structure, as is specified in the <a href="../javadoc/index.html">JavaDoc</a>.
It is more difficult to set up once, but the end goal is that you release a
smaller application, and your end users will (hopefully) appreciate it.</p>

<p>Another possible alternative solution that has been proposed is to try to
use <a href="http://proguard.sourceforge.net/">ProGuard</a>. We do not have any
experience with it.</p>
